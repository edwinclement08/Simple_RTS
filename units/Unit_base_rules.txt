Things to define in the subclass of:-


                <<1>> unit_non_attacking
    Variables
name = <string> # name of unit
type = <type_name> # only if unit is mot a  building
health = <int>
image_file = <string> # is the filename of images
w = <int> \_ # width and height(no of tiles)
h = <int> /
selection_options = <dict> # holds the options the object shows when selected
frame_delay_time =<int> # time each frame is delayed; default is 200

    Methods
do_selection(selected_option) # Obvious

any_other_stuff() # Obvious

    Variables
name = <string> # name of building
type = 'building'||'unit' # to know whether it is movable
attacks = True||False # to know whether it attacks
attacking_power = <int>  \
range = <int>            |_ Obvious
speed = 1||2||3            |
health = <int>           /

    Methods
move(path_as_tile_by_tile_movement_in_list # obvious,use pixel-by-pixel movement internally
                                           # use some instance variable to depict time last displaced
                                           # and the movements left
attack(<tuple(x,y)>) # obvious
                     # first check in range or not

update() # updates the surface
         # overwrite this if unit is attacker
